Hello!
I am working on creating an app to search for a users ranking, number of pixels placed, and a breakdown of how many pixels of each color placed.
For now there are 3 text files:
* ranking.txt has a ranking of user and how many pixels they have placed.
* user_color_count.txt show how many pixels of each color a user placed.
* user_top_cord.txt show the coordinate that each user place a pixel the highest number of times.

place_data_only.csv is the raw data for all of the pixels placed. It removes all the "pixel_undo" and "mod_rollback" entries.

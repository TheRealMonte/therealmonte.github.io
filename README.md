# Canvas Stats
Hello!

I have created an app that lets you view data from the [Canvas event](https://canvas.fediverse.events/). The data was taken from the sql file [Grant](https://toast.ooo/u/grant) provided. It is possible some pixels are missing due to the Canvas server crashing a few times during the 2024 event.

### Canvas Stats Features
* View the final stats for both the 2023 and 2024 events, such as the number of pixels placed of each color or number of instance's users that participated in the events.
* View the User rankings list for 2023 and 2024
* For the 2024 event, view images of just one color of pixels placed on the canvas (see screenshot #4)
* View a user's stats, such as overall rank, pixel color count, and the coordinate they placed the most pixels on.
* User stats page will also link to their stats page for the other year
* View all of the pixels a user placed
